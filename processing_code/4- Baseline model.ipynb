    "Creates the baseline model, and gets results for placing one new grocery store. This is the analysis a policy analyst, with no background in data science, would perform. We assume that they would simply download the data, calculate the percentage of individuals identified as food insecure  within each census tract, and sort in descending order based on the calculation. We assume the analyst would then identify the most food insecure area relative to the most densely populated tract and determine the location of a new grocery store based on the most food insecure area with the largest population. While the analyst is most likely to perform this analysis in Excel, we use Python for the purpose of consistency. \n",
