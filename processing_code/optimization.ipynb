    "This notebook performs the optimization task to find the location where a new grocery store should be placed, to maximize access\n",
    "\n",
    "How this works (implementation):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the helper_population_allocation.py to allocate a population count to each residential building (not ready yet, some placeholder function in there)\n",
    "2. Use the helper_distance_calculation.py to calculate existing access and distance between a residential and commercial building\n",
    "3. Once 1 and 2 are done, all parameters are ready. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then this notebook does some pre optimization setup and then runs an optimization model in Gurobi. It's pretty anti climatic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Update the population allocation helper file\n",
    "- Decide how to uniquely identify a building\n",
    "- Once the above is done, perform aggregation on the access dataframe to get the access variable (we need to do a max aggregation to get the actual access value. For that, we need to know how to uniquely identify a building)\n",
    "- Make sure ordering of arrays and matrices are correct so that the gurobi solution can be mapped back to the actual building (as far as I know, it's difficult to use Gurobi with dataframes, hence this)\n",
    "- Once everything seems to work, run the function to calculate distance between commercial and residential buildings on the full dataset to save the output as a csv, because that thing would take 2-3 hours)"
